As a user,
I can choose the size, crust and toppings that I want and order as many pizzas as I want.

I should place an order and for my pizza.

See a checkout button that when clicked shhows the total amount charged for the orders.

I should have an option to to have the pizza delivered or not.

an alert showing how much the delivery charge will be and another alert sayiong "your order will be delivered to your location."
